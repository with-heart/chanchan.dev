### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the "Create a site in the cloud" series.

In this series we'll purchase a domain, set up and configure cloud hosting, create a basic site, and configure automatic deployments so that changes to your site are automatically pushed to the cloud.

You'll learn how to:

- purchase a domain from [Namecheap]
- set up all the parts of [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][aws] you need to host your site: S3, Cloudfront, Route53, and more
- route traffic from your domain to AWS
- create a starter site using [Gatsby]
- host your site's code on [GitHub]
- automatically deploy your code changes using [GitHub Actions]

It's my hope that this series enables you to quickly and cheaply deploy and host a site and leaves you with a basic understanding of the tools involved.

If you run into any problems or have questions/comments/concerns, please don't hesitate to [open an issue on the `chanchan.dev` GitHub repo][github/chanchan.dev]. If you find errors in a post, I'd love it if you'd click the "Edit this page on GitHub" at the bottom of the page and submit a pull request!
